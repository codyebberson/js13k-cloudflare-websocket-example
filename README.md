# js13k-cloudflare-websocket-example

Example app that demonstrates:

- Cloudflare Workers
- Cloudflare Wrangler
- Cloudflare Durable Object

## Why?

[js13kGames](https://js13kgames.com/) is an annual game jam focused on creating browser games that are under 13 kilobytes.

The competition has a "server" category for multiplayer games. While single player games can use simple static file hosting, multiplayer games require a persistent server for stateful connections using [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API).

Historically, server games ran on Heroku thanks to Heroku's generous free tier. However, as of November 28, 2022, [Heroku discontinued free product plans](https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter). Therefore, the server category needs a new hosting option.

While there are many hosting providers, there are not many that meet the js13kGames requirements:

- Free
- Supports server side runtime
- Supports WebSockets

This project is a proof-of-concept of a js13kGames-style server game running on Cloudflare Workers. Cloudflare requires a credit card on file, but the free tier includes:

- Workers
  - 100k requests per day
- Durable Objects
  - 400,000 GB-second duration
  - 1 GB of stored data
  - 1 million read units
  - 1 million write units
  - 1 million delete operations

This is not an advertisement for Cloudflare. This is a proof-of-concept to test feasibility.

## Localhost

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:codyebberson/js13k-cloudflare-websocket-example.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
cd js13k-cloudflare-websocket-example
npm ci
```

3. Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open a web browser

> <http://localhost:5173>

## Deployment

1. Login to your Cloudflare account with Wrangler

```bash
npx wrangler login
```

2. Publish your Worker to Cloudflare

```bash
npx wrangler publish
```

You may be prompted to enable Durable Objects:

```bash
Your worker has access to the following bindings:
- Durable Objects:
  - servers: GameServer
Total Upload: 4.83 KiB / gzip: 1.78 KiB

âœ˜ [ERROR] A request to the Cloudflare API (/accounts/xxxxxxxxxx/workers/scripts/js13k-cloudflare-websocket-example) failed.

  In order to use Durable Objects, you must agree to pricing at
